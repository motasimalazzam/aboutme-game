# LAB - 05b

## aboutme-game

I built a website with a quiz game. The content of the questions is information about me and the user answers them with yes or no. Add two guessing questions, one is guessing a number between 1 and 10, and the other is guessing at least one player out of 4 players.

### Reflections and Comments

* How did this go, overall?

* It was fun adding colors and designs to the project using CSS and exploring the features that could be added

* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

* I have no question about this lab.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

* It took me about two hours and that's almost what I expected
